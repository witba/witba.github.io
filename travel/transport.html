OVERLAND TRANSPORT<br>

FLIGHTS<br>
Buying tickets early doesn't necessarily get you a better price. Sometimes buying a few wees or days before the flight, when the airlines need to fill empty seats can be better. Different airlines will have special offers at different times.<br>
To get the lowest price, be flexibe with the date you are flying and check the prices frequently. Look for alternative connections with multile stopovers and search these legs separately.<br>
