OVERLAND TRANSPORT<br>
<br>



FLIGHTS<br>
Buying tickets early doesn't necessarily get you a better price. Sometimes buying a few wees or days before the flight, when the airlines need to fill empty seats can be better. Different airlines will have special offers at different times.<br>
To get the lowest price, be flexibe with the date you are flying and check the prices frequently. Look for alternative connections with multile stopovers and search these legs separately.<br>
Make yourself familiar with low-cost airlines and the routes they operate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines

Learn the routes of long-haul low-cost airlines. Some worth knowing are: <br>
Airasia (Malaysia to Australia)
Scoot (Singapore to Europe and Australia)
Norwegian (Europe to N. America and S-E Asia)
Wizz Air (E. Europe to Middle East)
Pegasus (Europe to Middle East via Istanbul)
WOW Air (N. America to Europe via Iceland)
TUI fly Belgium (Belgium to Africa and Caribbean)
Eurowings (Germany to N. America, Southern Africa and Thailand)
Vueling (Spain to W. Africa and Middle East)
Cebu Pacific (Philippines to Middle East and Australia)

I never understood people who spend hundreds of dollars on more expensive flights that are "more comfortable". Would you pay 300$ on a more comfortable couch if you only get to sit in it for a few hours?
