OVERLAND TRANSPORT<br>
<br>
<br>
BUS/MINIVAN<br>
Learn the system for the country you're in. Sometimes you pay online, sometimes at the ticket office, sometimes to the driver, sometimes to the conductor. <br>
Sometimes there is a main bus station, sometimes the buses are scattered around the city. Usually you can hail down buses as they pass by.<br>
Sometimes there is a schedule, sometimes the buses only leave when full. <br>
The drivers might be competing with each other. They will rush you to their bus/minivan and then you have to wait an hour for it to fill up with passengers. To avoid this, get inside buses that look almost full. If there are no passengers inside then it is unlikely to be leaving soon.<br>
Negotiate the price and don't get overcharged. If in doubt, ask other passengers what the price is.<br>
<br>
TRAIN<br>
Sleep on the train or bus to save money on accommodation.<br>
<br>
SHARED TAXI<br>
In some countries this is a common form of public transport. It's like hitchhiking but you're expected to pay. Simply wave down a passing car or tricycle and say where you're going. Sometimes there is a fixed fare but usually you have to negotiate the price. The driver will make stops on the way to pick up more passengers. The drivers might also wait for passengers at set points, e.g. outside a train or bus station.<br>
<br>
TAXI/MOTORBIKE TAXI<br>
Always negotiate the price before you get in. <br>
Never put your bags in the trunk.<br>
Don't trust the drivers. They will try to scam you or sell you something. Better stick to public transport or walking or use ride-hailng apps.<br>
<br>
HITCHHIKING<br>
Wait at intersections or places where cars need to slow down. Make sure there is enough space for a car to stop. <br>
It is often better to keep walking down the road rather than waiting in one spot. This will signal the drivers that you're not a lazy bum but someone putting in effort. You might even reach another intersection with better traffic.<br>
Be friendly and ready to chat with the drivers, they are often looking for a good conversation.<br>
Expect to wait much longer if you are two or more people, especially if you're both male.<br>
Don't get in the car if you have a bad feeling about the driver. Make up some excuse (e.g. "I need to wait for my friend").<br>
In some countries the thumb gesture is considered rude.<br>
<br> 
FLIGHTS<br>
Buying tickets early doesn't necessarily get you a better price. Sometimes buying a few weeks or days before the flight can be cheaper. Different airlines will have special offers at different times.<br>
To get the lowest possible price, be flexibe with the date you are flying and check the prices frequently. Look for alternative connections with multile stop-overs and search these legs separately.<br>
Make yourself familiar with low-cost airlines and the routes they operate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines
Learn the long-haul routes of these airlines. Some worth knowing are: <br>
Airasia (Malaysia to Australia)
Scoot (Singapore to Europe and Australia)
Norwegian (Europe to the Americas and S-E Asia)
Wizz Air (E. Europe to Middle East)
Pegasus (Europe to Middle East via Istanbul)

Airtransat
<br>
I don't understand the point of spending hundreds of dollars on more expensive flights that are "more comfortable". Would you pay 300$ on a more comfortable chair if you only get to sit in it for a few hours?
