PREPARATION<br>
<br>
Essentials:<br>
What are the entry requirements (<a href="visas.html" target=_blank>visas</a>, permits, vaccinations...)<br>
Is the country/region safe to visit? (check tavel advisory pages like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" target=_blank>this one</a> if not sure) <br>
What is the current situation (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/" target=_blank>holidays</a>, elections, unrest)<br>
What weather <a href="http://climatemaps.romgens.com/" target=_blank>can you expect</a>? Will you be at a high altitude?<br>
If going to multiple countries, how will you cross the borders? <a href="overland.html" target=_blank>Are land crossings open to tourists?</a> Are the flights expensive? <br>
How will you handle money? Can you use local ATMs?<br>
<br>
Also:<br>
Write down important information (bank card numbers, telephone numbers, plane tickets) using a secret code that only you can solve. Email it to yourself, along with scans of your documents (passport, insurance...).<br>
Sometimes it is worth to carry a printed copy of your passport. <br>
