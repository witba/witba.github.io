ACCOMMODATION<br>
<br>
Unless traveling during a national holiday you don't need to book anything in advance.<br>
In many countries you get a better rate by walking in than by booking online. A lot of cheap guesthouses are not listed online.<br>
Hostels are the cheapest option in weathy countries, but not necessarily so in poor countries, were a family-run guesthouse or an old, broken down hotel is often cheaper. Hostels' guests tend to be western and it's usually not possible to bargain the price - both these reasons make them more expensive.<br>
Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Ask around or use a guidebook, a booking website, or an app like Galileo to find where all the hotels are. Go there and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, visit the place next door. Having many hotels in one spot makes it easy to bargain.<br>
If you have no idea where to find accommodation, looking around bus or train sations is usually a good bet.<br>
