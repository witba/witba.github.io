ACCOMMODATION<br>
<ul>
<li>Unless traveling during a national holiday there's almost never a need to book accommodation in advance.<br>
<li>In many countries you get a better rate by walking in than by booking online. A lot of cheap guesthouses are not listed online.<br>
<li>Hostels (dormitory room) are the cheapest option in weathy countries, but not necessarily so in poor countries, were a family-run guesthouse or an old, broken down hotel is often cheaper. People staying at hostels tend to be westerners and it's usually not possible to bargain the price - both these reasons make them more expensive.<br>
<li>Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Ask around or use a guidebook, a booking website, or an app like Galileo to find where all the hotels are. Go there and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, visit the place next door. Having many hotels in one spot makes it easy to bargain.<br>
<li>If you have no idea where to find accommodation, looking around bus or train sations is usually a good bet. Restaurants might sometimes have a room for rent, or may know someone who does.<br>
<li>Sleep on trains and buses to save money on accommodation.<br>
</ul>
CAMPING<br>
<ul>
<li>Do your research about where is it allowed to camp in a given country.<br>
<li>In the countryside, try asking farmers if they mind you camping in their field. Some people might let you camp in their front yard.<br>
<li>If you don't know if you're allowed to camp, make sure you're not in plain sight. Wake up and leave early, ideally before dawn.<br>
<li>A campfire makes you very visible. Make sure there are no trees near the fireplace and no branches above it. Don't leave the fire until it is completely out. Never set up fires in a protected area, an urban area, or in someone's field, unless there is a designated spot.<br>
<li>Clean up after yourself and leave no trace. <br>
<li>Don't use any shampoo or soap to wash yourself in nature. Use sand to wash your dishes.<br>
<li>Don't shit near freshwater. Dig a hole and bury it or use public toilets.<br>
</ul>
