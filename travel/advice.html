PREPARATION<br>
<br>
Essentials:<br>
What are the entry requirements (visas, permits, vaccinations...)<br>
Is the country/region safe to visit? (heck tavel advisory pages like ... if not sure) <br>
What is the current situation (holidays, elections, unrest)<br>
What weather can you expect? Will you be at a high altitude?<br>
If going to multiple countries, how will you cross the borders? Are land crossings open to tourists? Are the flights expensive? <br>
How will you handle money? Can you use local ATMs?<br>

WAYS TO TRAVEL <br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist/family:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + rented car or tour bus
<li>Accommodation: Resort or hotel
<li>Food: At the resort/hotel
<li>Places to see: Stay in resort or hire a guide to visit famous sights
<li>What to pack: Whatever you want
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury but learn nothing about local life. In poor countries, your money can have a big impact. Make sure it's mostly good one (read more about responsible travel...)
<li>Budget: 500-&#8734 $/week
</ul>
<b>2. Independent backpacker:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + public transport. Sometimes rent a motorbike or bicycle. Private taxi only as a last resort. (Read my advice here)
<li>Accommodation: Hostel or budget hotel. Sometimes stay with friends or couchsurfing (My advice on finding accommodation)
<li>Food: local restaurant or market
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road (my recommendations)
<li>What to pack: One carry-on bag. Don't bring any camping gear unless you are sure you will use it. (my packing suggestions)
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck. (My advice)
<li>Budget: 200-600 $/week (My advice on handling money)
</ul>
<b>3. Adventurer/explorer/homeless:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Walk/hitchhike/bicycle/horesback/kayak/etc.
<li>Accommodation: Camping or couchsurfing. Sleep on a bus.
<li>Food: local market, dumpster, cook by yourself
<li>Places to see: Anywhere
<li>What to pack: Ideally, one carry-on bag, but can be difficult if camping in cold climate. Pack as light as possible. Consider bringing a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent to reduce the weight. (my advice on camping)
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will see places and have experiences that are unattainable to other travelers.
<li>Budget: 0-300 $/week
</ul>
All of these can be enjoyable in their own way, although many people can't afford #1 or #2. #3 can be a great option for both rich and poor people, but you need to be relatively fit and in good health.
