PREPARATION<br>
<br>
Essentials:<br>
What are the entry requirements (visas, permits, vaccinations...)<br>
Is the country/region safe to visit? (heck tavel advisory pages like ... if not sure) <br>
What is the current situation (holidays, elections, unrest)<br>
What weather can you expect? Will you be at a high altitude?<br>
If going to multiple countries, how will you cross the borders? Are land crossings open to tourists? Are the flights expensive? <br>
How will you handle money? Can you use local ATMs?<br>

<\ul>
<br>
<b>2. Independent backpacker:</b><br>

Accommodation: Hostel or budget hotel (agoda.com). Sometimes stay with friends or couchsurfing<br>
Food: local restaurant or market<br>

<br>
<b>3. Adventurer/explorer/homeless:</b><br>

Accommodation: Camping or couchsurfing. Sleep on a bus. <br>
Food: local market, cook by yourself<br>
Places to see: Anywhere<br>
What to pack: Ideally, one carry-on bag, but can be difficult in cold climate. Lightweight gear is essential. Consider bringing a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a ten to reduce the weight.<br>
Experience: See places other travelers will never get to visit.<br>
Budget: 0-300 $/week<br>
<br>
All of these can be great in their own way, although obviously many people can't afford #1 or even #2. #3 can be a fantastic option for both rich and poor people.
