<ul>
<li>Safety warnings for travelers are typically exaggerated, especially if you're used to living in European or American cities. If you use common sense, stay away from conflict zones and not do anything stupid you are unlikely to get into trouble.<br> 
<li>Take the advice from locals with a grain of salt, no matter how well intended. Most people travel very little and have misconceptions about safety, even in their own country. You may be told that a place is dangerous, you need a local guide, etc., when in fact it is completely safe. They may recommend a touristy place which is safe and pleasant for them, but as a foreigner you will be targeted by scammers and agressive sellers.<br>

<p>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>In general: traffic collisions, air pollution, food poisoning and pickpockets should be the main concerns. Violent crimes, especially against foreigners, are extremely rare in most parts of the world.</li>
<li>Your behaviour and attitude are important as they can give you away as a dumb, naive tourist. Try not to stand out from the crowd. Dress and act like the locals.</li>
<li>Be confident and act like someone living in the area minding your own business. Don't look lost and confused.</li>
<li>If you wander into an unsafe-looking area, walk confidently in the direction you came from.</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol or doing drugs makes you an easy target for thieves, scammers and rapists.</li>
<li>Traveling in your own car in an unsafe region makes you a target for bandits and terrorists. It is much more discrete to travel by bus or shared taxi.</li>
<li>Drugs, prostitution, etc: even if you feel like they are legal or tolerated, most likely they are not. People offering them often work with the police who will threaten you with jail unless you pay a huge bribe.</li>
</ul>
<p>TOUTS, CON ARTISTS, ETC</p>
<ul>
<li>These people can be a very annoying but don't let them ruin your mood or spoil your opinion about the locals. In any country they constitute a tiny fraction of the population, but as a tourist they will always target you. Make sure you go outside the touristy places and hang out with ordinary locals, not just with the touts. You will likely find them to be extremely kind and hospitable. </li>
<li>Touts ("hello friend!", "where you going?", etc): Don't respond. Just keep walking</li>
<li>Con artists: Don't get into conversations with them. The longer you spend talking the harder it is to get rid of them later. If you begin to suspect that your new "friend" is a scammer, make up some excuse and leave. Most often they are well dressed, speak good English, and know a lot about your country.</li>
<li>Don't be polite to anyone who refuses to leave you alone.</li>
<li>If you can't get rid of someone, try finding refuge in a shop or restaurant.</li>
<li>Even if the scammer becomes aggressive, don't let that intimidate you - they have no interest in physically hurting you. Police generally turn a blind eye on scams; violent crime is taken much more seriously.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t trust people who approach you offering hotels, bus tickets, tours, etc. You will overpay or get an invalid ticket.</li>
<li>Don't accept "free" gifts from strangers.</li>
<li>If you are looking to buy something, avoid the sellers who specifically target tourists.</li>
<li>Beggars: <a href="ethics.html" target=_blank>see here.</a></li>
<li>The reason why these people are so persistent is because it works. Most tourists eventually give some money, which only makes the problem worse. Make no concessions. Don't feel guilty about it, the people who harass tourists earn a lot more than many hard-woking, honest people. If you want to be generous, donate to a charity or to poor people who don't harass anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>THEFT</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel light and walk quickly to avoid being an easy target. Be cautious when taking public transit and in large crowds where you have to slow down. Carry your bag on your chest in crowded places.</li>
<li>Pickpockets often have an accomplice whose job is to distract you. Be cautious when something unusual happens around you. It might be someone bumping into you, a beggar, a child, an old lady. </li>
<li>Avoid pants with pockets that are easy to pick. Jeans-style pockets are excellent. A hidden pocket can be useful, you can sew one to the inside of your pants.</li>
<li>In hotels, don't leave your valuables in plain sight. Even hiding them under a pillow is better than not hiding them at all.</li>
<li>Beware of children.</li>
</ul>
<p>VIOLENCE</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you are being followed: walk into a shop, a restaurant, etc.; cross the street, head to lively area.</li>
<li>If confronted, run away or yell for help in local language.</li>
<li>If you throw some money or a wallet at your attacker and run, he might not chase you. Consider carrying a wallet filled with small bills that you can give away.</li>
<li>Don't fight. The attacker obviously has more experience than you. Stay calm and don't get rushed. If you're lucky, someone will show up and scare the atteckers away.</li>
<li>If the attacker carries any weapon, don't resist. Avoid eye contact and hand over your belongings.</li>
<li>Carrying a weapon with you is an easy way to get killed.</li>
<li>If you can't avoid a fight, protect your face and upper body. Try to surprise the attacker. Hit them as hard as you can, then immediately run away. Don't be afraid to fight dirty if your life is at stake.</li>
</ul>
