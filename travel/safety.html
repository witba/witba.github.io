<p>SAFETY</p>
<ul>
<li>In general: traffic collisions, air pollution, food poisoning and pickpockets should be the main concerns. Violent crimes, especially against foreigners, are extremely rare in most parts of the world.</li>
<li>Your behaviour and attitude are important as they can give you away as a dumb tourist who doesn't know the local ways. Try not to stand out from the crowd. Dress and act like locals do.</li>
<li>Be confident and act like someone living in the area minding your own business. Don't look lost and confused.</li>
<li>If you wander into an unsafe-looking area, walk confidently in the direction you came from.</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol or doing drugs makes you an easy target for thieves, scammers and rapists.</li>
<li>Traveling in your own car in an unsafe region makes you a target for bandits and terrorists. It is much more discrete to travel by bus or shared taxi.</li>
<li>Drugs, prostitution, etc: even if you feel like they are legal or tolerated, most likely they are not. Police will turn up and threaten you with many years in jail unless you pay a huge bribe.</li>
</ul>
<p>TOUTS, SCAMMERS, ETC</p>
<ul>
<li>Touts, persistent beggars and scammers can be a major annoyance when traveling in places where you look foreign, especially in touristic spots of developing countries.</li>
<li>It is best to completely ignore them. Don't get into conversations with them. The longer you spend talking the harder it is to get rid of them later.</li>
<li>Don't be polite to anyone who refuses to leave you alone.</li>
<li>If you can't get rid of someone, try finding refuge in a shop or restaurant.</li>
<li>That said, there are many genuinely friendly locals who simply want to chat with foreigners, especially in places with few tourists. Use common sense and learn to sense fake friendliness. If you begin to suspect that your new "friend" is a scammer, make up some excuse and leave.</li>
<li>Don't let scammers spoil your opinion about the locals. In any country, scammers and solicitors constitute a tiny fraction of the population, but as a tourist, they are often the type most likely to approach you.</li>
<li>"Normal" people are unlikely to approach you in tourisity places where they are used to foreigners. This is where scammers operate.
</ul>
<p>THEFT</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel light and walk quickly to avoid being an easy target. Avoid large crowds where you have to slow down. Carry your bag on your chest in crowded places.</li>
<li>Pickpockets often have an accomplice who will try do distract you. It might be a beggar, a child, an old lady, someone bumping into you. Be cautious when something unusual happens around you.</li>
<li>In hotels, ground floor is the least secure. Never leave your valuables in plain sight. Even hiding them under a pillow is better than not hiding them at all.</li>
<li>Beware of children.</li>
</ul>
<p>VIOLENCE</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you are being followed, walk into a shop, a restaurant, etc. Cross the street, head to lively area.</li>
<li>If confronted, run away or yell for help in local language.</li>
<li>Consider carrying a wallet filled with small bills and an expired bank card that you can hand over to attackers.</li>
<li>If you throw some money or a wallet at your attacker and run away, he might not chase you.</li>
<li>Don't fight. The attacker obviously has more experience than you. Stay calm and move slowly, hopefully a bystander will show up.</li>
<li>If the attacker carries any weapon, don't resist. Avoid eye contact and hand over your belongings.</li>
<li>Carrying a weapon with you is a good way to get killed.</li>
<li>If you can't avoid a fight, protect your face and upper body with your arms and try to surprise the attacker. Hit them as hard as you can, then immediately run away. Don't be afraid to fight dirty if your life is at stake.</li>
</ul>
