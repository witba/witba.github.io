<ul>
<li>Altitude sickness: Worse than most people think. It can kill you and even if you don't notice severe symptoms it can do permanent damage to your brain. Being fit and healthy doesn't help you avoid it. Be careful when going above 3000 m and give yourself enough time to get acclimatized when going higher. <br>
<li>Hygiene: wash your hands often and avoid touching your eyes or mouth. Don't neglect minor cuts on your skin, especially in places with poor hygiene. Make sure they heal properly.<br>
<li>Food: Eat cooked food that is served hot. Eat fruits that you have washed and peeled yourself. Avoid meat. Avoid salads and leafy vegetables that are difficult to wash. Don't drink untreated water. Avoid drinks with ice. Treat water by boiling it or use filter and/or disinfectants. Most filters can't remove viruses.<br>
<li>Mosquitos: transmit many awful diseases, especially malaria. Wear long pants, long sleeves, use mosquito net and repellent. Avoid rainy season. Malaria pills can be bad for you, better not to use them if not visiting <a href="https://map.ox.ac.uk/explorer/#/explorer" target=_blank>high-risk areas.</a> Malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquitos only bite at night. Aedes (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) mosquitos (dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika) only bite during the day, dusk and dawn. Culex mosquitos (Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever) bite in the evening and night. <br>
<li>Rabies: be careful around dogs<br>
<li>Snake bites: most dangerous of the "dangerous animals", especially in South Asia and Africa.<br>
<li>Ticks: check your body for ticks after visiting the wilderness in N. America and Europe (Lyme disease).
<li>Vaccinations: Yellow Fever vaccinaion certificate (valid for 10 years) is required to visit <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/maps/en/" target=_blank>some African countries</a>. Other contries may require it when arriving from a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever#5291" target=_blank>country at risk of Yellow Fever.</a><br> Other vaccines to consider: hepatitis A and B (lifelong protection), typhoid (~5 year protection, only 50-70% effectiveness), rabies. Routine vaccines: measles-mumps-rubella, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, chickenpox, polio, flu<br>
