BORDER CROSSINGS<br>

Note:<br> 
It is possible to enter Colombia from both Brazil and Peru in Leticia in the very South, but the city is in the middle of the Amazon jungle and has no connection with any other city in Colombia except by plane.<br>
It is technically possible to enter North Korea from South Korea in a place called "Joint Security Area" (you don't even need a visa), but you can't travel anywhere further.
