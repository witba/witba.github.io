MONEY: BEFORE YOU LEAVE<br>
<ul>
<li>Find a bank that does not charge for international transactions or foreign ATM withdrawals. ING, Citibank in Australia, many credit unions in USA.
<li>Exchanging cash in a western country will likely get you terrible rates, especially at airports. It's better to exchange money in non-western countries. Beware of scams and hidden commissions, always count your money.
</ul>
HANDLING MONEY<br>
<ul>
<li>Keep coins and small bills for daily expenses seperate from large bills and other valuables (e.g. in a different pocket).
<li>Don't carry any large money in a wallet. Wallets are easily spotted by thieves.
<li>It is probably safer to leave valuable items at the hotel than to always carry them with you. 
<li>Keep some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, in case you get robbed or can't find a working ATM. US dollar is easy to exchange anywhere in the world.
<li>Some foreign ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Always choose local currency to avoid rip-off rates.
</ul>
<b>Some tips on saving money:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>To have money for travel, focus on saving it in expensive countries, not in cheap countries (especially if you're someone who spends 7$ for a beer back home). It's good for your wallet and for global equality. In a poor country your money can do a lot more good, both for you and for local people, than in a rich country.
<li>Avoid staying in touristy areas.
<li>If you live in an expensive city, renting out your room while you're away can often save enough money to cover your entire trip.
</ul>
