HANDLING MONEY<br>
Find a bank account that does not charge for international transactions or foreign ATM wihdrawals. ING, Citibank in Australia, many credit unions in USA.<br>
Some foreign ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Always choose local currency to avoid rip-off rates.<br>
Traveler cheques, travel cards, etc are probably not worth getting because of exchange rates and because you will have unspent money after your trip.<br>
Exchanging cash in a western country will likely get you terrible rates. It's better to exchenge money after you arrive. USD and Euro usually get the best rates. Airports tend to have the worst exchange rates. Beware of scams and hidden commissions, always count your money.<br>
<br>
MONEY - SECURITY<br>
Avoid traveling with a lot of cash. Don't keep all your valuables in one place.<br>
Carry some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, in case you get robbed or can't find a working ATM. US dollar is the easiest to exchange in most of the world.<br>
I usually carry coins and small bills in my pocket for daily expenses, while lerge bills, debit cards and passport are somewhere well hidden, or at the hotel. Avoid pants with pockets that are easy to pick. Jeans-style pockets are excellent. Hidden pocket can be useful, you can sew one to the inside of your pants.<br>
Don't keep any large money in a wallet or money belt as these are easliy spotted by thieves.<br>

<b>A few tips on saving money:</b><br>
It doesn't make sense to travel in a third world country on 5$ a day by sleeping in a park and eating rotten bananas if you're someone who pays 7$ for a beer back home. It's bad for your wallet and bad for global equality. In a poor country your money can do a lot more good, both for you and for local people. To have money for travel, save it in expensive countries, not in cheap countries.<br>
If you live in an expensive city, renting your room while you're away can often save enough money to cover your entire trip.<br>
