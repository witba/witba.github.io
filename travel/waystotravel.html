MAIN WAYS TO TRAVEL <br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist/family:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + rented car or tour bus
<li>Accommodation: Resort or hotel
<li>Food: At the resort/hotel
<li>Places to see: Stay in resort or hire a guide to visit famous sights
<li>What to pack: Whatever you want
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists but learn nothing about local lifestyle. In poor countries, the money you spend can have a big impact. Try to make it a good one (<a href="ethics.html">read more about responsible travel...</a>)
<li>Budget: &gt;500 $/week
</ul>
<b>2. Road trip/cruise:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Your own car/motorbike/yacht
<li>Accommodation: Camping and paid
<li>Food: cook by yourself, local restaurant or market
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road or sea
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, spare parts, etc.
<li>Experience: You have more independence but won't get much local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you are less lonely.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week
</ul>
<b>3. Independent backpacker:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + public transport. Sometimes rent a motorbike or bicycle. Private taxi only as a last resort. (<a href="transport.html">read more</a>)

<li>Food: local restaurant or market
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road
<li>What to pack: One carry-on bag. Something to read. Don't bring any camping gear unless you are sure you will use it. (<a href="packing.html">my packing suggestions</a>)
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week (<a href="money.html">my advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
<b>4. Adventurer/explorer/hobo:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Walk/hitchhike/horseback/bicycle/kayak/etc. (<a href="transport.html">my hitchhiking tips</a>)
<li>Accommodation: Camping, squatting, couchsurfing, sleeping on a bus. (<a href="accommodation.html">my advice on camping</a>). If you worry about not showering, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/i-stopped-showering-and-life-continued/486314" target=_blank>read here.</a>
<li>Food: local market, dumpster, cook by yourself
<li>Places to see: Anywhere, but this is the best way to see real wilderness that others can't access.
<li>What to pack: Ideally, one carry-on bag, but can be difficult if camping in cold climate. Pack as light as possible. If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent. (<a href="packing.html">read more</a>).
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will see places and have experiences that are unattainable to other travelers.
<li>Budget: 0-200 $/week (<a href="money.html">my advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
All of these can be enjoyable in their own way, although many people can't afford #1-3. #4 can be a great option for both rich and poor people, but you need to be relatively fit and in good health.
