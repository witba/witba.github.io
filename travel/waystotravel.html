WAYS TO TRAVEL <br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist/family:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + rented car or tour bus
<li>Accommodation: Resort or hotel
<li>Food: At the resort/hotel
<li>Places to see: Stay in resort or hire a guide to visit famous sights
<li>What to pack: Whatever you want
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by people exactly like you but learn nothing about local life. In poor countries, your money can have a big impact. Make sure it's mostly good one (read more about responsible travel...)
<li>Budget: 500-1 million $/week
</ul>
<b>2. Independent backpacker:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + public transport. Sometimes rent a motorbike or bicycle. Private taxi only as a last resort. (Read my advice here)
<li>Accommodation: Hostel or budget hotel. Sometimes stay with friends or couchsurfing (My advice on finding accommodation)
<li>Food: local restaurant or market
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road (my recommendations)
<li>What to pack: One carry-on bag. Don't bring any camping gear unless you are sure you will use it. (my packing suggestions)
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck. (My advice)
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week (My advice on handling money)
</ul>
<b>3. Road trip/cruise:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Your own car/motorbike/yacht
<li>Accommodation: Camping and paid
<li>Food: cook by yourself, local restaurant or market
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road or sea (my recommendations)
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, spare parts, etc.
<li>Experience: You have more flexibility but won't get much local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you are less lonely.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week (Even more if driving alone)
</ul>
<b>4. Adventurer/explorer/homeless:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Walk/hitchhike/horesback/bicycle/kayak/etc.
<li>Accommodation: Camping, couchsurfing, squatting, sleeping on a bus.
<li>Food: local market, dumpster, cook by yourself
<li>Places to see: Anywhere, but this is the best way to see real wilderness that others can't access.
<li>What to pack: Ideally, one carry-on bag, but can be difficult if camping in cold climate. Pack as light as possible. If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent to reduce the weight. (my advice on camping)
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will see places and have experiences that are unattainable to other travelers.
<li>Budget: 0-200 $/week
</ul>
All of these can be enjoyable in their own way, although many people can't afford #1-3. #4 can be a great option for both rich and poor people, but you need to be relatively fit and in good health.
