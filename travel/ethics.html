<p>DON'T BE ANNOYING</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be an arrogant douchebag. You are a guest. Be modest, don’t assume you are better or wiser than the locals. Obey local norms and behaviour, including dress code. Don’t criticize things you know little about.
<li>Many people find it rude to take photos of them without asking their permission. Even if they are too polite to refuse you, it can be very annoying to be treated as a tourist attraction. 
<li>"Slum tours", "orphanage tourism": do you walk around your hometown and take photos of children and homeless people? Why do it in India or Kenya?
<li>Respect ancient sites. Do not take "souvenirs" (pebbles, rocks) from the site. Do not touch sculptures or carved rocks, as that slowly erodes them.
<li>Don't follow the example of locals or tourists who litter. Minimize your use of plastic and cosmetics. Most developing countries don't have the facilities to recycle or safely dispose waste so it ends up polluting the environment. 
</ul>
<p>SPENDING MONEY</p>
<ul>
<li>In developing countries, support the local economy. Avoid foreign-owned hotels and restaurants, buy locally produced goods, support traditional skills. Give less popular establishemts a chance.
<li>Luxury travel uses up a lot of resources. This has at least two negative effects: 1. Poor local people can no longer afford some of these resources (e.g. clean water, electricity); 2. destruction of the environment (logging, mining, pollution, sewage). Sometimes indigenous people are displaced to make space for your resort. You are giving money to a very rich class in the tourism business, not to ordinary people. 
<li>Human/animal exploitation, drugs, products made from endangered species, stolen artifacts: don't create a demand for them.
<li>By giving money to solicitors, scam artists, beggars, dishonest sellers and corrupt officials you are making the problem worse. These people are usually very rich by local standards.
<li>Bargaining is expected in many parts of the world. Don't overpay as it contributes to inflation which makes it harder for poor locals to afford many products and services.
<li>Don’t bargain too far. Sometimes the seller may be desperate to earn some money, but paying 3$ for handicraft that took a whole day to make is disgraceful.
<li>Traffic jams and pollution are huge problems in many cities. By driving a private car or taxi you contribute to the problem.
<li>Flights and cruise ships harm the environment more than other means of transport (per distance per passenger).
