PACKING<br>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are going somewhere extremely remote, you can always buy things at your destination. The only things you relly need to bring are your passport and a bank card.
<li>Pack light. Bring a few clothes and handwash them. With a small backpack, you can visit many places in one day without ever checking in to a hotel and then take an overnight bus to another city. With a big backpack, you have to get a taxi and find a hotel every time you arrive in a new place. You will walk slowly and have touts and scammers following you, who, combined with heat and exhaustion will make you feel miserable. Sometimes you need to pay extra to bring luggage on a plane - it is cheaper to buy things at your destination than to pay the luggage fee.
<li>Instead of bringing many warm clothes, wear several layers of tshirts and pants if it gets cold.
<li>Don’t look like a tourist. Try to dress like locals do. Avoid expensive-looking clothes, backpack, gadgets, etc. A big backpack will immediately make you stand out and draw unwanted attention. A cheap, small, normal-looking backpack is much safer.
<li>If you choose to buy "outdoor clothing”, find something normal-looking, without a visible logo or reflective parts.
<li>If you need clothes for "going out" or formal events, try to get versatile ones that can also be worn throughout the day. 
<li>Sneakers or sandals are usually the best shoes for hiking. Hiking boots are heavy, hot, and take long to dry; they’re helpful only on very rough or icy terrain.  
<li>Instead of bringing a guidebook, print out a few maps and notes about the places you will visit. A printed map can easily fit in your pocket and is less conspicuous than a guidebook or a phone or a big tourist map in your hand.
<li>People laugh when they see me using a compass but it's reliable, fast and doesn't need a battery. Get a tiny one for 1$.
<li>Save some space for food and water.
</ul>
GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>People have lived in places like the Andes, the Amazon, or Sahara for thousands of years without Goretex jackets or hiking boots. Even today, the only people who you see wearing "outdoor gear" in these places are tourists. Unless you're planning some extreme expedition, you don't need any expensive items. High-tech gear does not provide as much benefit as is advertised and always comes with drawbacks.
<li>That said, if you have money to spend, spend it on lightweight, durable items.
<li>When contemplating whether to buy lightweight but expensive gear, try to put a price on the weight. How much would you pay to have stuff weighing 1kg less? 5kg less? Value all your items accordingly.
</ul>
CAMPING GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>Only bring camping gear if you are sure you will need it. 
<li>Instead of bringing a tent, consider a bivy bag or a hammock. In addition to being lighter, they can be set up in many places where a tent can't be, e.g. a dense forest, a terrace, a boat, under a wagon. In some areas a mosquito net will be needed.
<li>Get a light, compact sleeping bag or quilt and sleep with a few layers of clothes if it gets cold. You won't need a sleeping bag in the tropics.
<li>Get a light, inflatable matterss or don't bring one at all and lie down on your clothes and your backpack.
<li>A poncho-tarp might be useful.
<li>Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove" target=_blank>stove from a can</a> (a simple design <a href="https://vimeo.com/64726512" target=_blank>here</a>). Bring along alcohol fuel in small bottles that can go to carry-on. Use a metal mug for cooking and handling food and aluminium foil as a lid. Plastic spoon and knife (if flying).
</ul>
