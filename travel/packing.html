PACKING<br>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are going somewhere extremely remote, you can always buy things at your destination. The only things you relly need to pack are your passport and a debit card.
<li>Pack as light as possible. A carry-on bag can fit everythig you need to travel forever. 
<li>Bring a few clothes and handwash them. You don't need more than 4 tshirts.
<li>Get items/clothing that are versatile and can work in different weather conditions. Instead of bringing many warm clothes, wear several layers of tshirts and pants if it gets cold.
<li>Don’t look like a tourist. Try to dress like locals do. Avoid expensive-looking clothes, backpack, gadgets, etc. A big backpack will immediately make you stand out and draw attention from touts and thieves. A cheap, small, normal-looking backpack is much safer.
<li>If you choose to buy "outdoor clothing”, find something normal-looking, without a visible logo or reflective parts so that you don't stand out if you wear them in a city.
<li>If you need clothes for "going out" or formal events, try to get versatile ones that can also be worn throughout the day. 
<li>Sneakers or sandals are usually the best shoes for hiking. Hiking boots are heavy, hot, and take ages to dry; they’re helpful only on very rough or icy terrain.  
<li>Unless you are very serious about photography, a smartphone or a compact camera that fits in your pocket is better than a DSLR.
<li>Instead of bringing a guidebook, print out a few maps and notes about the places you will visit. A printed map can easily fit in your pocket and is less conspicuous than a guidebook or a phone or a big tourist map in your hand. Look for pdf versions of a guidebook and print the maps from there.
<li>Toiletries: bring only what you really need, in small bottles.
<li>Save some space in your bag for food and water.
</ul>
GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>People have lived in (not just traveled through) places like the Andes, the Amazon, or Sahara for thousands of years without Goretex jackets or hiking boots. Even today, the only people who you see wearing "outdoor gear" in these places are tourists. Unless you're planning some extreme expedition, you most likely don't need any expensive items. High-tech gear does not provide as much benefit as is claimed and always comes with drawbacks. For example, GoreTex is quite heavy and bulky and not for hot weather. 
<li>That said, if you have some money to spend, it might be worth investing in lightweight items.
<li>When buying gear, the difficult choice to make is often “low price or low weight”. Try to put a price on the weght. How much would you pay to have stuff weighing 1kg less? 5kg less? If, for example, 1 kg is worth 200$ for you, then getting a 450g, 150$ sleeping bag over a 1kg, 20$ one might not be worth it. Likewise, a phone that weighs 50g less should be worth 10$ more to you.
</ul>
CAMPING<br>
<ul>
<li>Only bring camping gear if you are sure you will need it. 
<li>When hiking, the more you carry the slower you go, and therefore the more you have to carry. 
<li>Instead of bringing a tent, consider a bivy bag or a hammock. In addition to being lighter, they can be set up in many places where a tent can't be, e.g. a dense forest, a terrace, a ferry, under a wagon. Tent poles and pegs can't go to carry-on in some countries. 
<li>Get a light, compact sleeping bag and wear a few layers of clothes if it gets cold.
<li>Get a light matterss or don't bring one at all and lie down on your clothes and backpack.
<li>A poncho-tarp can be a good choice.
<li>Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove" target=_blank>stove from a can</a> (a very simple design <a href="https://vimeo.com/64726512" target=_blank>here</a>). Bring along alcohol fuel in small bottles that can go to carry-on. Use a metal mug for cooking and handling food and aluminium foil as a lid. Plastic spoon and knife (if flying).
</ul>
